#You are given two classes, Person and Student, where Person is the base class and Student is the derived class. Completed code for Person and a declaration for Student are provided for you in the editor. Observe that Student inherits all the properties of Person.

# Complete the Student class by writing the following:

# A Student class constructor, which has 4 parameters:
# A string, firstName.
# A string, lastName.
# An integer, idNumber.
# An integer array (or vector) of test scores, scores.
# A char calculate() method that calculates a Student objectâ€™s average and returns the grade character representative of their calculated average:
